# [Modelling conformational state dynamics and its role on virulence for SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein variants]

## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected individuals, families, health care systems, societies and the world economy. Whereas great advances have been achieved in record time, a lot remains to be learned about the infection mechanisms of its causative agent, the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein interacts with the human acetylcholinesterase 2 receptor as part of its entry mechanism. To do so, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike needs to be in an open state conformation. Here we utilise coarse-grained normal mode analyses to model the dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein as well as the transition probabilities between open and closed conformations for the wild type and the D614G mutant as well other variants isolated experimentally. We proceed to perform several possible in silico single mutations of Spike, 17081 in total, to determine positions and specific Spike mutations that may affect the occupancy of the open and closed states. We calculate transition probabilities between the open and closed states using the overlap of eigenvectors from one state to another. Transition probabilities are employed in a Markov model to determine state occupancies. Our results correctly model a shift in occupancy of the more virulent D614G strain towards higher occupancy of the open state via an increase of flexibility of the closed state and concomitant decrease of flexibility of the open state. We utilize global vibrational entropy differences to select candidate single point mutations that affect the flexibility of the open and closed states and confirm the shift in occupancies for the most critical mutations. Among those, we observe that a number of mutations on residue K417 have an effect similar to that of D614G. This is, to our knowledge, the first use of normal mode analysis to model conformational state transitions and the effect of mutations. The specific mutations of Spike identified here, while still requiring experimental validation, may guide future studies to further our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanisms and may guide public health in their surveillance efforts.

## What data is shown here?

The results for every calculation of dSvib for the closed and the open conformations are available here, as well as the difference between the deltas

In the first graph you can choose to look, for each site, at the median, maximum or minimum value between all 20 differences between deltas, for the WT (zero) and other 19 possible mutations. The selected positions on the first graph appear on the structure on the right and all the 20 values associated to the 20 amino acids appear on the second graph, in which you can choose to see the values for the open strucutre, the closed strucutre, or the score diff_delta considering both. According to the hypothesis we presented, the higher values of diff_delta represent the most infectious candidates and the lower values of diff_delta represent the least infectious candidates.
